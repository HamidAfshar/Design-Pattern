# **Adapter**
### Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

1. Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code.
2.  Use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that can’t be added to the superclass.
