# **Prototype**
### Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.



1. Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
2.  Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.
