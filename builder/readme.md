# **Builder**


Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

1. Use the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for example, stone and wooden houses).
2. Use the Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects.
